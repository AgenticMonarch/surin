# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SURIN (Subdomain Utility for Rapid Identification and Naming) is an advanced command-line subdomain discovery tool built in Python. The tool leverages multiple discovery methods including Certificate Transparency logs, threat intelligence APIs, and DNS enumeration to provide comprehensive subdomain reconnaissance capabilities. It is designed for security professionals, penetration testers, and researchers who need efficient and thorough subdomain discovery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want to discover subdomains using DNS enumeration, so that I can identify potential attack surfaces through common subdomain patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs DNS enumeration THEN the system SHALL query at least 60 common subdomain patterns
2. WHEN DNS enumeration is performed THEN the system SHALL resolve each subdomain to verify its existence
3. WHEN a valid subdomain is found THEN the system SHALL record the subdomain and its IP address
4. IF DNS resolution fails for a subdomain THEN the system SHALL continue with the next subdomain without stopping

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a penetration tester, I want to discover subdomains through Certificate Transparency logs, so that I can find subdomains that may not be discoverable through DNS enumeration alone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects Certificate Transparency discovery THEN the system SHALL query crt.sh API
2. WHEN CT logs are queried THEN the system SHALL extract all subdomain entries from SSL certificates
3. WHEN duplicate subdomains are found THEN the system SHALL deduplicate the results
4. IF the CT API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and continue with other methods

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to use multiple threat intelligence APIs, so that I can gather subdomain information from various security-focused data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN threat intelligence discovery is selected THEN the system SHALL query HackerTarget API
2. WHEN threat intelligence discovery is selected THEN the system SHALL query ThreatCrowd API
3. WHEN threat intelligence discovery is selected THEN the system SHALL query VirusTotal API
4. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff strategies
5. IF an API key is required but not provided THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select specific discovery methods, so that I can customize the reconnaissance approach based on my needs and available resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the tool THEN the system SHALL provide options to select individual discovery methods
2. WHEN no methods are specified THEN the system SHALL run all available methods by default
3. WHEN multiple methods are selected THEN the system SHALL execute them concurrently for better performance
4. WHEN method selection is invalid THEN the system SHALL display available options and exit gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see detailed results showing findings per method, so that I can understand which discovery techniques are most effective for my target.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN discovery completes THEN the system SHALL display results grouped by discovery method
2. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the count of subdomains found per method
3. WHEN subdomains are found THEN the system SHALL display them in a clear, readable format
4. WHEN no subdomains are found THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this to the user
5. WHEN duplicate subdomains are found across methods THEN the system SHALL indicate which methods discovered each subdomain

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tool to handle errors gracefully and provide informative feedback, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and continue with other methods
2. WHEN invalid domains are provided THEN the system SHALL validate input and provide helpful feedback
3. WHEN API keys are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on how to configure them
4. WHEN the tool encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL log the error details and exit gracefully
5. IF verbose mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging of all operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tool to perform concurrent processing, so that I can complete subdomain discovery quickly even when using multiple methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple discovery methods are used THEN the system SHALL execute them concurrently
2. WHEN DNS enumeration is performed THEN the system SHALL use concurrent threads for subdomain resolution
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits while maximizing throughput
4. WHEN concurrent operations complete THEN the system SHALL aggregate results efficiently
5. IF system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL provide options to control concurrency levels

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want a professional command-line interface, so that I can easily integrate the tool into my workflow and automation scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the tool THEN the system SHALL provide a clear command-line interface with help documentation
2. WHEN invalid arguments are provided THEN the system SHALL display usage information and exit with appropriate error codes
3. WHEN the tool runs THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators for long-running operations
4. WHEN results are ready THEN the system SHALL support multiple output formats (text, JSON, CSV)
5. IF the user requests help THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive usage examples and option descriptions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want a professional command-line interface that is easy to understand, so that I can quickly interpret the results and use the tool effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the tool THEN the result of each subdomain SHALL be displayed on a separate line for clear readability
2. WHEN the tool completes execution THEN the system SHALL display a summary showing the total number of subdomains discovered
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL indicate whether each subdomain resolves to a public or private IP address
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show the HTTP/HTTPS status code for each subdomain when available
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL indicate if any subdomains have open ports or services detected
6. WHEN displaying the summary THEN the system SHALL show statistics on unique IP addresses and network ranges discovered
